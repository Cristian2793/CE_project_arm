## Usage:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   - One group member (student) must fork this repository into their GitHub account.
   - Rename the fork according to your project name.

2. **Invite Team Members**

   - Search for the fork name and launch a new GitHub Codespaces environment.

4. **Collaborate Within Codespaces**
