# Project Template for the Module Applied Research Methods

## Usage:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   - One student (repository owner) must fork this repository into their GitHub account.
   - The repository owner must then rename the fork according to the project name.

2. **Invite Team Members**  
   The repository owner must invite all other group members as collaborators to the forked repository.  
   - Go to the fork, then to the upper menu > **Settings** > **Access** > **Collaborators**.  
   - Add your team members' GitHub usernames or email addresses one by one.

3. **Access the fork via GitHub Codespaces**
   - Each invited team member must access their own GitHub account.
   - Go to the **+** button in the upper menu, navigate to **New Codespace** and click on it. 
   - Search for the name of the fork with the project name and launch a new GitHub Codespaces environment.

4. **Collaborate Within Codespaces**
   - Commit and synchronize changes to your code and data with Visual Studio Code as often as possible.
   - If you have conflicts when merging, solve them with the integrated merge editor in Visual Studio Code.
   - Extent the Python libraries listed in requirements.txt if neccessary.

5. **Directory Structure**
