# Project Template for the Module Applied Research Methods

## Usage:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   - One student (repository owner) must fork this repository into their GitHub account.
   - The repository owner must then rename the repository according to the project name.

2. **Invite Team Members**  
   The repository owner must invite all other team members as collaborators to the forked repository.  
   - Go to the fork, then to the upper menu > **Settings** > **Access** > **Collaborators**.  
   - Add your team members' GitHub usernames or email addresses one by one.
   - All invited team members must accept the invitation to collaborate.

3. **Access the fork via GitHub Codespaces**
   - Ensure each invited team member is logged into their own GitHub account.
   - Navigate to the project repository (no need for a fork) by including the repository URL in the address bar of the browser 
     (e.g. https://github.com/repository-owner/project-name)
   - If you see the repository in the browser, click the green **Code** button and go to the Codespaces tab.
   - Click on the **+** sign then **Create a codespace on master** to launch a new GitHub Codespaces environment.

4. **Check Permissions**
   - Verify that you have the necessary access (e.g., write or collaborator access) to interact directly with the repository.
   - If unsure, check the repository's settings or contact the repository owner.

5. **Collaborate Within Codespaces**
   - Commit and synchronize changes to your code and data with Visual Studio Code as often as possible.
   - If you have conflicts when merging, solve them with the integrated merge editor in Visual Studio Code.
   - Install additional Python libraries and extent requirements.txt if neccessary.

6. **Directory Structure**
```
